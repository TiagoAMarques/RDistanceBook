**From outline... Models for detectability: introduction   to the detection function, what makes a good detection function? (Only presenting half-normal and hazard-rate models here.)**

What became clear in the previous chapter is that when we model the effect of detectability in our surveys we can reliably estimate abundance.

  * here is some real data
  * oh right, you see that drop off?
  * how do we fit a model
  * what is that doing?
  * let's talk about truncation
  * let's talk about model selection
  * point and lines
  * estimating abundance HT etc
