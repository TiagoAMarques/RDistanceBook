# Mark-recapture distance sampling


Notes:

 * Borchers et al HMM paper notes that "correction factor methods should not be used to correct for availability bias, except perhaps when animals are within range for a very short time relative to the typical length of time they area available."

## Outline

 * key assumption in (M)CDS is that g(0)=1
 * plenty of times this is not the case
 * use two observers
    - io
    - rem
    - trial
 * point vs. full independence
 * (when are these methods applicable/appropriate)
 * don't forget point transects
 * explain this in a useful rather than general way
