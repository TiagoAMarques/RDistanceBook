# Abundance in the study area

So far we have only investigated the abundance in the covered area -- the area that we physically walked (or flew or steamed etc) through. Generally we're interested in extrapolating beyond that, to the rest of a forest or area of the sea etc. In some systems it may be reasonable to assume that the whole study area is homogeneous (e.g. if it's at the same altitude/depth or has the same flora growing there or similar geographical features). Unfortunately this usually is not true. We often survey terrestrial areas where part of the study area is a bog, part is open fields part is forested; or a marine environment where depth or salinity changes in a way that affects the study species. The second section of this book concerns how to explicitly deal with this problem when data is spatially explicit using a more complex modelling strategy. However, one alternative to that strategy is using a stratified analysis.

**Write code for this**

**Should I plot the spatial distribution or transect lines here?**
