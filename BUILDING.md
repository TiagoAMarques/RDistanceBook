Building the book
-----------------

Software required to get the book to build:

  * `R` >=3.1.2
  * For `R` package versions, see rdistancebook.github.io/rversions.html
  * `pandoc` >= 1.13.2
  * `make`


Running `make` in this directory should build the pages in a folder called `site`.

Please let me know if this doesn't work for you!
