# General modelling (SDMs, philosophy, niche modelling etc):

  * [X] Warren, DL. “In Defense of ‘Niche Modeling’.” Trends in Ecology & Evolution 27, no. 9 (2012): 497–500. doi:10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.010.
    - We should say "niche" modelling because that's more accurate -- are our predictions really vaid outside the niche? Spatial covariates much better predictors than environmental (in sample area!)
  * [X] McInerny, GJ, and RS Etienne. “‘Niche’ or “Distribution” Modelling? a Response to Warren.” Trends in Ecology & Evolution 28, no. 4 (2013): 191–92. doi:10.1016/j.tree.2013.01.007.
    - Warren (2012) has it wrong, niche implies too much (linking survival, reproduction, environmental factors) that we can't model. SDM is a neutral term.
  * [X] Sillero, N. “What Does Ecological Modelling Model? a Proposed Classification of Ecological Niche Models Based on Their Underlying Methods.” Ecological Modelling 222, no. 8 (2011): 1343–46. doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.01.018.
    - "Soberón (2010) made a distinction between species distribution models (for predicting strictly the species’ distribution) and ecological niche models (for forecasting an approximation to the species’ niche)." Can correlative models really find niches? More terminology (yay): realised vs fundemental niche (do correlative models give fundemental niches? Predict in suitable areas that are uninhabited due to tectonic movements etc -- this dude (and lots of others) think(s) "no" (and that they are only modelling the realised niche) because of the spatial part of the spatial model, but I think maybe yes?) Also presence & presence/absence models are problematic in this respect. "when calculating ensemble models (Araújo and New, 2007), we are mixing different species niches." "the distribution of suit- able habitats that is being predicted by the model, rather than the species’ distribution per se (Pearson, 2007)."

    - "Overdispersion occurs primarily for two reasons; ‘apparent overdispersion’ (Hilbe, 2011) arises when models have been poorly specified, for example by failing to include important predictors, interactions between predictors that have already been measured, or by specifying the incorrect link function (Hilbe, 2011). Conversely, ‘real overdispersion’ can arise when there is clustering in the count data, meaning observations are not truly independent of one another (Hilbe, 2011), when there is an excess number of zeroes in the data (zero-inflation) (Zuur et al., 2009), or when the variance of the response truly is greater than the mean". "It is perhaps reassuring, and not surprising, that modeling the data with the same structure that was used to generate the data recovers correct, unbiased estimates"

    - "OLS regression" stable under autocorrelation? Check for stationarity! "Pocket plots" -- what are they? Why is non-stationarity present? "Pure" functions of space/other covariates vs. mixtures. "Grain size" (segment size) issues -- fewest false positives (see Hurlbert & Jetz, 2007; Hawkins et al., 2008). "A lack of knowledge about how processes influence patterns across scales also underlies the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of spatially explicit regression models." ~ "there is no effect" type assumptions are at least transparent?
  * [X] Kühn, I, and CF Dormann. “Less Than Eight (and a Half) Misconceptions of Spatial Analysis.” Journal of Biogeography 39, no. 5 (2012): 995–98.
    - spatial trends vs. autocorrelation. Contrary to the above, many papers claim spatial autocorrelation does affect coefficient estimates. Spatial autocorrelation in data vs. residuals. Spatial residual plots should be presented as part of the analysis!
  * [X] http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2012/05/12/spatial-autocorrelation-in-statistical-models-friend-or-foe/
    - confusion between spatial autocorrelation (which is fine) and residual spatial autocorrelation (unmodelled, bad).
