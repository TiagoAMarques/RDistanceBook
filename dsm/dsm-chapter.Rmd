    - pull lots of this from MEE paper
 * Data sets used in this chapter
 * Data setup for a DSM
    - resolution
    - selecting segment length
    - possible sources
    - effort
 * Constructing DSMs
    - roadmap for the rest of the chapter
    - model construction flow diagram
    - actual model construction stuff
       - assume that detection function stuff already done?
       - "knot" selection
       - response distributions (when/why/how)
       - smoothing in general
 * Model checking (maybe this should be rolled in with the above?)
    - simple gam.check stuff
    - autocorrelation checks
    - influence checks
 * Prediction
    - covariate values
    - variance estimation
    - integrating out certain parameters?
