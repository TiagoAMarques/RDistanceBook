# Constructing density surface models

## Steps to a DSM analysis

 * Detection function
     * fit detection functions
     * check absolute fit by $\chi^2$, if not possible use visual inspection
     * use best model by AIC
 * DSM
     * fit model with all covars (using method="REML")
     * ensure that k~=k'
     * cut covars back using select=TRUE and p-values
     * default use negative binomial for sea birds, can fit theta at the same time as other pars
     * check other response distributions (using qq plot)
     * check for residual autocorrelation (using dsm.cor)
     * check predictive power? (Oppel's test? is this BS?)





## Response distributions

 * counts
 * keep as close to the original measure as possible?


### Negative binomial

 * finding $\theta$
   - when using the `c(low,high)` form, don't make the interval too short?
     - if it's too small then the surface is too flat
     - optimisation takes aaaaages

### Tweedie

 * line search
 * only need to cary by 0.1 along line
 * plot `sqrt(abs(residuals)`, AIC?
